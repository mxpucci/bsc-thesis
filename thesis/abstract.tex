Graphs have become increasingly influential in both research and industrial contexts, as they provide a flexible way of modeling interconnected, multimodal information through nodes and edges. Graph Databases (GDBs), in particular, have emerged as key tools for managing and analyzing graph-structured information. Although commercial GDB solutions are widely adopted, they frequently exhibit time and space inefficiencies, especially when handling static datasets, resulting in suboptimal performance due to memory hierarchy constraints. To tackle these inefficiencies, we developed a computation-friendly compressed Graph Database optimized for static or slightly dynamic data scenarios.

In this thesis, we first introduce a technique for compressing graph adjacency lists, which achieves best-in-class compression performance relative to existing approaches on most of our evaluated datasets. Expanding upon this, we then extend our approach to efficiently support Labelled Property Graphs by enriching the compressed graph structure with node and edge properties. A wide set of experimental benchmarks on real-world labeled graph datasets shows that our Compressed Graph Database not only substantially outperforms commercial state-of-the-art solutions in terms of both time and space efficiency, but also clearly lies on the Pareto curve of time-space tradeoffs when compared to other graph compressors.
