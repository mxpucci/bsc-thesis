After some opening remarks, we motivate and contrast various graph-based data models, as well as languages used to query and validate knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge graphs.},

We describe Cypher 9, which is the first version of the language governed by the openCypher Implementers Group. We first introduce the language by example, and describe its uses in industry. We then provide a formal semantic definition of the core read-query features of Cypher, including its variant of the property graph data model, and its ASCII Art graph pattern matching mechanism for expressing subgraphs of interest to an application. We compare the features of Cypher to other property graph query languages, and describe extensions, at an advanced stage of development, which will form part of Cypher 10, turning the language into a compositional language which supports graph projections and multiple named graphs.},

There is a direct correspondence between the structure of the coefficient matrix, called the stiffness matrix in this case, and the structure of the spatial network delineating the element layout. For the efficient solution of these systems of equations, it is desirable to have an automatic nodal numbering (or renumbering) scheme to ensure that the corresponding coefficient matrix will have a narrow bandwidth. This is the problem considered by R. Rosen1. A direct method of obtaining such a numbering scheme is presented. In addition several methods are reviewed and compared.},

Although several papers have investigated the properties and usefulness of this data structure in the full-text indexing scenario, its impact on data compression has not been fully explored. In this paper we provide a throughout theoretical analysis of a wide class of compression algorithms based on Wavelet Trees. Also, we propose a novel framework, called Pruned Wavelet Trees, that aims for the best combination of Wavelet Trees of properly-designed shapes and compressors either binary (like, Run-Length encoders) or non-binary (like, Huffman and Arithmetic encoders).}

This data structure uses at most 5nHk(T) + o(n) bits of storage, where Hk(T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T. The space usage is Θ(n) bits in the worst case and o(n) bits for compressible texts. This data structure exploits the relationship between suffix arrays and the Burrows--Wheeler Transform, and can be regarded as a compressed suffix array.Our second compressed data structure achieves O(p+occ) query time using O(nHk(T)logε n) + o(n) bits of storage for any chosen ε, 0<ε<1. Therefore, it provides optimal output-sensitive query time using o(nlog n) bits in the worst case. This second data structure builds upon the first one and exploits the interplay between two compressors: the Burrows--Wheeler Transform and the LZ78 algorithm.},

abstract = {Studying web graphs is often difficult due to their large size. Recently,several proposals have been published about various techniques that allow tostore a web graph in memory in a limited space, exploiting the inner redundancies of the web. The WebGraph framework is a suite of codes, algorithms and tools that aims at making it easy to manipulate large web graphs. This papers presents the compression techniques used in WebGraph, which are centred around referentiation and intervalisation (which in turn are dual to each other). WebGraph can compress the WebBase graph (118 Mnodes, 1 Glinks)in as little as 3.08 bits per link, and its transposed version in as littleas 2.89 bits per link.},

abstract = { The proliferation of online graph data — such as produced on social networks, citation networks, and online graph databases — calls for space-efficient graph indexing methods that support fast graph queries and graph analytics. Labeled property multidigraphs as a model of representing complicated graph data are widely used in practice. However, the fundamental problem of compressing and indexing labeled property multidigraphs has remained unsolved. In this paper, we focus on the static data case and propose a novel self-index, called CGraphIndex, to compress and index labeled property multidigraphs that for the first time achieves the high-order entropy space for multidigraph properties (the dominant term in practice) and the 1st-order graph entropy for multidigraph structures. A self-index actually encodes the original input and thus there is no need to store the input separately. CGraphIndex supports fundamental and navigational operations on the structures and on the properties in constant time, and supports fast property extraction on vertices and edges. Our experimental results on the large LDBC SNB benchmarks demonstrate that CGraphIndex outperforms the popular graph database systems (Community Editions), generally several times to orders of magnitude faster in query time and several times less in space usage for the compared interactive complex queries, business intelligence queries, as well as typical graph analytics BFS and PageRank. },

We give a data structure that supports both operations in O(1) time on the RAM model and requires B(n, m) + o(n) + O(lg lg m) bits to store a set of size n, where B(n, m) = ⌊lg (m/n)⌋ is the minimum number of bits required to store any n-element subset from a universe of size m. Previous dictionaries taking this space only supported (yes/no) membership queries in O(1) time. In the cell probe model we can remove the O(lg lg m) additive term in the space bound, answering a question raised by Fich and Miltersen [1995] and Pagh [2001].We present extensions and applications of our indexable dictionary data structure, including:—an information-theoretically optimal representation of a k-ary cardinal tree that supports standard operations in constant time;—a representation of a multiset of size n from {0,…,m − 1} in B(n, m + n) + o(n) bits that supports (appropriate generalizations of) rank and select operations in constant time; and + O(lg lg m)—a representation of a sequence of n nonnegative integers summing up to m in B(n, m + n) + o(n) bits that supports prefix sum queries in constant time.},

abstract = {The Elias-Fano representation of monotone sequences has been recently applied to the compression of inverted indexes, showing excellent query performance thanks to its efficient random access and search operations. While its space occupancy is competitive with some state-of-the-art methods such as gamma-delta-Golomb codes and PForDelta, it fails to exploit the local clustering that inverted lists usually exhibit, namely the presence of long subsequences of close identifiers. In this paper we describe a new representation based on partitioning the list into chunks and encoding both the chunks and their endpoints with Elias-Fano, hence forming a two-level data structure. This partitioning enables the encoding to better adapt to the local statistics of the chunk, thus exploiting clustering and improving compression. We present two partition strategies, respectively with fixed and variable-length chunks. For the latter case we introduce a linear-time optimization algorithm which identifies the minimum-space partition up to an arbitrarily small approximation factor.We show that our partitioned Elias-Fano indexes offer significantly better compression than plain Elias-Fano, while preserving their query time efficiency. Furthermore, compared with other state-of-the-art compressed encodings, our indexes exhibit the best compression ratio/query time trade-off.},
